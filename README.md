#FCUDA Backend Flow

- This repository contains many backend and platform projects for integration
with the FCUDA C compiler (or front-end) to provide a complete FCUDA system
(CPU + FPGA with many FCUDA cores as accelerators).

    + fcuda_bus: The hierarchical AXI-bus backend coupled with Design Space 
    Exploration project.
    + fcuda_noc: The FCUDA Network-on-chip backend project.
    + fcuda_soc: The FCUDA SoC platform with simpler bus backend project.


- There are scripts and documents inside these project directories to help user
kickoff. More importantly, please also check the relevant publications for better 
insight on them (see file: **license.txt**).
